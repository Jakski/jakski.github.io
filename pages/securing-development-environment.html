	<p>Before I delve into details and requirements for secure development environment
let me highlight some unsettling news provoking this post:</p>

</ul>
<p>All mentioned events have at least one thing in common: they abuse fundamental
trust between software users and software maintainers/publishers. I know that
these kind of attacks aren't new, but they become more and more viable in modern
age when the most of code in projects is usually downloaded as a dependency
provided by third-party. Also software development becomes more vibrant with new
projects and releases occurring every day. As a developer you can of course pay
attention to code you're using and lock dependencies in projects where possible,
but no one has enough time to keep up with all changes in external modules and
package managers. It's also especially hard to grasp when you're working on
multiple projects or languages. There's always a chance that you will
accidentally run malicious code masquerading as a dependency required by
project. This risk can't be easily excluded in fast moving teams. Production
ready infrastructure usually deploys strict security policies and provisions
applications with access only to required resources. What about developer
workstation? I rarely hear about anyone protecting themselves from project
they're working on. More often people assume that whatever they get from
internal repository can be trusted including it's dependencies.</p>
<h1>Attack surface</h1>
<p>Let's consider some scenarios of attacks directed at developer workstations to
get a glimpse of a problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to be intentionally paranoid here. In the end trust is always
required to push project forward. Yet I'll try to spot as many risks as
possible just, so we can focus on mitigating potential damage later on.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Malicious code in dependencies</h2>
<p>Probably the most obvious. We like to keep our projects updated, so we don't pin
dependencies to certain versions. Instead we specify, that we want the latest
version from some major release number. It's a quick win for getting new
security updates, but at the same time we add a new crucial person to our
project - maintainer. E.g. if maintainer's SSH key for repository gets
compromised, then our project is also at risk.</p>
<h2>Integrated development environments abuse</h2>
<p>I also mean all integrated development environments(IDEs) extensions and
language servers. It's cool, if they just statically analyze projects without
attempting to run their parts for validation. Problem appears when they're
somehow tricked into running some third-party code or opening some security
holes when working remotely. See some examples for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/50646/Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Code.html?vendor_id=26">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/49160/Jetbrains-Intellij-Idea.html?vendor_id=15146">Intellij Idea</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Malicious code in IDE dependencies</h2>
<p>Running near real-time code analysis and providing sensible hints for developer
isn't and easy task. That's why single extension can sometimes be a deciding
factor for what IDE you're going to use and that's why a lot of vendors ship
language-flavored versions of their products. Hinting developer is in fact, so
complicated task that people more often tend to write specific background
services independent from IDEs just to handle their favourite language. That's
where <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server
Protocol</a> shines.
Language servers are usually, so complex that they have dependencies on their
own. Everything can be ok with your project, but you can still be a victim
because of malicious dependency in IDE.</p>
<h1>What's to be protected</h1>
<p>Workstation of course. Whether it's our laptop or some remote desktop, we rarely
run workstation with access to exactly one repository and nothing else. The most
obvious target while attacking developers would be probably their SSH keys and
browser data. Both of which usually allow to fully impersonate victim and
publish changes on their behalf.</p>
<p>Other projects. Having separate sandbox environment for all projects may not
quite cut it. Malicious code in one project shouldn't result in overtaking them
all. Think of it as of multi-tenancy problem. We have one environment consisting
of our laptop and we need to run several development environments, isolating
them from each other and protecting host. It's the similar scenario we see in
virtualization and container orchestration platforms.</p>
<h1>Possible approaches</h1>
<h2>Run with limited access</h2>
<p>Probably the most comfortable solution, but requires some work. The idea is to
run IDE and applications as we would normally do, but assign them extra security
policy. We don't isolate processes, but instead ensure that they don't peek
into sensitive directories. It's comfortable, because we can reuse interpreters,
compilers and tools installed on host operating system without any extra work.</p>
<p>Example solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>AppArmor</li>
<li>SELinux</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run in sandbox</h2>
<p>We will talk a lot about it in future posts. This approach assumes, that we
don't trust a bit any of code and run it in entirely different environment from
out host operating system. The biggest downside is of course that we need to
somehow mirror our tools in order to use them.</p>
<p>Example solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podman</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>LXC</li>
<li>QEMU(and libvirt)</li>
<li>systemd-nspawn</li>
<li>Firejail</li>
<li>seccomp</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run in remote environment</h2>
<p>Works similarly to sandboxing, but protects us from hardware vulnerabilities
like processor exploits. Paying bill for cloud resources at the end of the month
instead of provisioning locally sounds great, but keep in mind that running
whole IDE with code on VM in shared hosting environment requires trusting
hosting provider. Of course remote environment could also mean our old laptop
sitting in house, but usually we need something more reliable than our home
internet connection.</p>
<p>Example solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practically any virtual private server provider</li>
<li>Owned hardware exposed via forwarded port on router</li>
</ul>
