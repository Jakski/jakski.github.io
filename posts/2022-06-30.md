# 2022-06-30 Configuring fail-over in Nginx

What it means that a web server provides fail-over? It's usually understood as a
warranty that service will continue working even, if one of many instances stops
functioning correctly. Ideally client shouldn't even notice that some instance
ceased to serve requests. I'm going to walk you through configuring fail-over in
Nginx and explain some useful features. Our stack will be:

- Two instances of mock HTTP web services written in Python
- Nginx 1.23.0

## Web service

First let's mock HTTP application with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from socketserver import TCPServer


class WebService(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(int(os.environ.get("GET_CODE", 200)))
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b"Lorem Ipsum\n")

    def do_POST(self):
        self.send_response(int(os.environ.get("POST_CODE", 200)))
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b"Lorem Ipsum\n")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ["PORT"])
    with TCPServer(("0.0.0.0", port), WebService) as httpd:
        print(f"Serving at port: {port}")
        httpd.serve_forever()
```

We will run 2 instances of this script on ports 8081 and 8082.

## Simple upstream configuration

Our first setup will consist of simple upstream without any tunings.

```
upstream webserver {
  server 127.0.0.1:8081;
  server 127.0.0.1:8082;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name localhost default_server;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://webserver;
  }
}
```

### What guarantees do we have?

Unhealthy state means different things for different applications. By default
Nginx will serve 50x responses to users and treat them as healthy behaviour.

```
# Instance 1
$ PORT=8081 GET_CODE=500 /webserver.py
# Instance 2
$ PORT=8082 GET_CODE=500 /webserver.py
# Attempt to query in separate terminal
$ curl -sSiLX GET http://localhost
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Server: nginx/1.23.0
Date: Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:08:24 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive

Lorem Ipsum
```

Note that `Lorem Ipsum` came in response, meaning that Nginx actually passed our
request to backends and returned response. If we stop one of our instances and
query service again we will see in Nginx log entries like:

```
2022/06/30 17:11:53 [error] 175#175: *64 connect() failed (111: Connection refused) while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/", host: "localhost"
2022/06/30 17:11:53 [warn] 175#175: *64 upstream server temporarily disabled while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/", host: "localhost"
127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jun/2022:17:11:53 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 22 "-" "curl/7.83.1" "-"
```

Nginx gracefully handled outage and served client request without any issue. The
only way to effectively crash application is to take down all application
servers:

```
# On client side
$ curl -sSiLX POST http://localhost
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
Server: nginx/1.23.0
Date: Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:16:19 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 157
Connection: keep-alive

<html>
<head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.23.0</center>
</body>
</html>

# In Nginx log
2022/06/30 17:17:00 [error] 175#175: *3166 no live upstreams while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "POST / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://webserver/", host: "localhost"
127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jun/2022:17:17:00 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 502 157 "-" "curl/7.83.1" "-"
```

## Getting rid of 50x errors

What, if our application server communicate with some external resources like
databases and only one instance can't reach them properly? Or let's assume that
the latest deployment of our application wasn't successful and one instance
constantly returns 50x response codes.

Nginx allows us to decide what it means that backend is unhealthy. In previous
example it was response code agnostic, but we can change that with
`proxy_next_upstream` directive like so:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name localhost default_server;
  location / {
    proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
    proxy_pass http://webserver;
  }
}
```

Let's start our application servers in the following setup:

```
# Instance 1
$ PORT=8081 /webserver.py
# Instance 2
$ PORT=8082 GET_CODE=500 POST_CODE=500 /webserver.py
```

Now 50x errors will be handles gracefully and reported in logs:

```
2022/06/30 20:20:34 [warn] 1767#1767: *3198 upstream server temporarily disabled while reading response header from upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/", host: "localhost"
127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jun/2022:20:20:34 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 22 "-" "curl/7.83.1" "-"
```

There's only one exception to this protection: non-idempotent HTTP methods.
By design they're introducing changes and repeating them might have unwanted
consequences. By default they will be still returned, no matter what response
code gets back. This behaviour can be changed with `non_idempotent` parameter
in `proxy_next_upstream` directive, but keep in mind that repeating requests
like POST and PATCH might result in unexpected problems. For example, if user is
creating a new entry on forum with POST, then repeating this request might
create 2 same entries. This behaviour will be surely confusing. Even when Nginx
marks backend as unhealthy, it still tries to pass new request in some
intervals. Solely detecting unhealthy instance and performing fail-over doesn't
solve issue.

> If you're using `upstream`, it might be worth tuning
> `proxy_next_upstream_tries` as well. Otherwise bad requests might end up
> bouncing from backend to backend, causing tremendous load on your
> infrastructure.

## Unfinished HTTP response

Nginx configuration is resetted to our first example without
`proxy_next_upstream` customization. This time the second application instance
will be actually `netcat` TCP server:

```
# Instance 1
$ PORT=8081 /webserver.py
# Instance 2
$ nc -lp 8082
```

It's as easy as pressing `CTRL + C` in terminal to finish TCP connection in
`netcat`.

```
# netcat output
$ nc -lp 8082
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: webserver
Connection: close
User-Agent: curl/7.83.1
Accept: */*

^Cpunt!

# Nginx log
2022/06/30 20:43:35 [warn] 1839#1839: *3265 upstream server temporarily disabled while reading response header from upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/", host: "localhost"
127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jun/2022:20:43:35 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 22 "-" "curl/7.83.1" "-"

Connection: keep-alive

Lorem Ipsum
```

OK, Nginx handled that perfectly. Client had no idea that some backend just
disappeared while serving request. I also tried to send partial response, but
the result was the same. Yet I've found one case where Nginx won't use next
upstream:

```
# curl output
$ curl -sSiLX GET http://localhost
curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed

# netcat output
$ nc -lp 8082
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: webserver
Connection: close
User-Agent: curl/7.83.1
Accept: */*

malformed-response

# Nginx logs
2022/06/30 20:53:14 [error] 1840#1840: *3306 upstream sent no valid HTTP/1.0 header while reading response header from upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8082/", host: "localhost"
127.0.0.1 - - [30/Jun/2022:20:53:15 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 009 19 "-" "curl/7.83.1" "-"
```

It's extremely rare case, because application server has to make errors in HTTP
protocol for this to happen. These days HTTP is usually handled on framework
level, so developers are protected from making such errors in business logic
code.
