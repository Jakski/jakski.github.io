of assigning a command result to a variable:</p>
<pre><code>output=$(some_command)
</code></pre>
<p>What you're most likely aware is that this creates a subshell, which is spawned
as a separate process. If you plan to invoke an external program, then there's
no workaround for this. With functions this is the most straightforward, but
not the fastest(runtime) way to get a result. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    echo &quot;result&quot;
}

echo &quot;Invoked in subshell&quot;
time (for i in {1..10000}; do (fn) &gt;/dev/null; done)
echo
echo &quot;Invoked directly&quot;
time (for i in {1..10000}; do fn &gt;/dev/null; done)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Invoked in subshell

real    0m9.619s
user    0m6.325s
sys     0m3.594s

Invoked directly

real    0m0.243s
user    0m0.162s
sys     0m0.079s
</code></pre>
<p>In 10 thousand loops we've got over 9 seconds of difference. I've immediately
discarded results of <code>fn()</code>, but in real life we would typically want to save it
in some variable. For most scripts even such a long execution time will be
acceptable, but in rare cases you'll wonder how to postpone using another
language by optimizing a current solution. Let's talkover a few methods for
doing that.</p>
<h1>Predefined variable for passing a results</h1>
<pre><code>declare RESULT

fn() {
    RESULT=&quot;result&quot;
}

declare accumulator=&quot;&quot;
time (for i in {1..10000}; do fn; accumulator+=&quot;$RESULT&quot;; done)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>real    0m0.059s
user    0m0.059s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
<p>With only a few changes we've gained a tremendous performance boost. So what's
the catch? Our function now modifies a variable from outer scope. If you control
the calling environment, then this is fine. Problem appears when <code>RESULT</code> is
already used for something else in outer scope. Now usage of this additional
variable becomes a part of our function interface and all callers must be aware
of this. If you or your colleague forget about it, then you might end up
spending a lot of time, debugging what went wrong.</p>
<h1>Pipelines</h1>
<p>If you need to call some function repeatedly, then it might be worth to move the
loop into a function itself. If you still need to process results one-by-one,
then you can run it in pipeline.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    declare counter=$1
    while [ &quot;$counter&quot; != 0 ]; do
        echo &quot;result&quot;
        counter=$((counter - 1))
    done
}

declare line
time (fn 10000 | while IFS=&quot;&quot; read -r line; do echo &quot;$line&quot; &gt;/dev/null; done)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>real    0m0.309s
user    0m0.264s
sys     0m0.136s
</code></pre>
<p>Last process in pipe is still executed in subshell. It's still way more optimal
than running 10 thousand subshells, but also prevents you from accessing
variables in caller's scope. You skip this limitation by using <code>lastpipe</code> shell
option.</p>
<h1>Indirection with namerefs</h1>
<p>Bash allows you to reference a variable by value stored in other variable. It
works like a pointer. One way to achieve that is by using a namerefs.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    declare -n dest=$1
    dest+=&quot;result&quot;
}

time (declare result=&quot;&quot;; for i in {1..10000}; do fn result; done)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>real    0m0.076s
user    0m0.076s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with namerefs is that they occupy a scope with yet another variable
name.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    declare -n dest=$1
    declare result=&quot;result&quot;
    dest+=&quot;$result&quot;
}

time (declare result=&quot;&quot;; for i in {1..2}; do fn result; done; echo &quot;$result&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>You would expect <code>result</code> variable to contain <code>resultresult</code>, right? Well,
that's not Bash will handle this situation. As far as I understand this is an
undefined behaviour, but on my system <code>result</code> variable ended up being empty.
This means that namerefs impose a similar limitation as a solution with
predefined variable. Caller still needs to be aware what name is reserved.</p>
<h1>Indirection with eval</h1>
<p><code>eval</code> builtin can be very dangerous, so always think twice before using it. If
arguments are not sanitized, then it can easily lead to malicious code
injection. Having this in mind Bash provides 2 ways to avoid unsolicited word
splitting or expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>printf &quot;%q&quot;</code> - builtin allowing to output shell-escaped values</li>
<li><code>${var@Q}</code> - parameter expansion using a <code>Q</code> transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of them help us ensure that argument we pass are actually treated as a
single argument with proper quotting and escaping. Let's say that now our
function needs to add some provided argument to result.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    eval &quot;${1}+=${2}&quot;
}

time (declare result=&quot;&quot;; for i in {1..2}; do fn result &quot;a; echo hacked&quot;; done; echo &quot;$result&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>hacked
hacked
aa

real    0m0.000s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
<p>See the 2 lines <code>hacked</code>? This is the proof that we manage to inject arbitrary
code into function. That's usually not what we want, so let's fix it with
transformation.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    eval &quot;${1}+=${2@Q}&quot;
}

time (declare result=&quot;&quot;; for i in {1..2}; do fn result &quot;a; echo hacked&quot;; done; echo &quot;$result&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>a; echo hackeda; echo hacked

real    0m0.000s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
<p>Now we're relatively safe.</p>
<h2>(Ab)using positional parameters</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that this method still doesn't allow us to use our own
variables, since there may be a collission with <code>$1</code> passed from the caller.
We aren't safe to declare our own variable, so the only variables local to our
function are positional parameters. You can change them using <code>set -- arg1 arg2</code>
shell builtin. This method makes your code very unreadable, but sometimes choice
is an absent luxury. Let's say that for some reason you need to backquote square
brackets and uppercase an argument to function.</p>
<pre><code>fn() {
    set -- &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${2//\]/\\]}&quot;
    set -- &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${2//\[/\\[}&quot;
    set -- &quot;$1&quot; &quot;${2^^}&quot;
    eval &quot;${1}+=${2@Q}&quot;
}

time (declare result=&quot;&quot;; for i in {1..2}; do fn result &quot;[value]&quot;; done; echo &quot;$result&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>\[VALUE\]\[VALUE\]

real    0m0.001s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
